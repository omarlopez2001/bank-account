# bank-account
Project title: Bank Account
Description: I created a Python program that simulates a bank account.
Programming language used: Python 3.8.3

For print_receipt method, I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19084443/replacing-digits-with-str-replace to learn how to sensitize the first four digits of the account number with asterisks. 
To randomly generate the eight digits for the account number, I used random.randint(10000000,99999999), which I learned from https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-generate-a-random-number-of-length-n-in-python and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32050155/how-to-generate-multiple-9-digit-random-numbers-in-one-go-and-add-a-prefix-numbe
